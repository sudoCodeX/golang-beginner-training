### 💻 Core Example: Hello World

The structure is minimal. Every executable needs `package main` and the entry function `func main()`.

Go

```
package main // The entry point package

import "fmt" // Import the format package

func main() { // The function that executes
    fmt.Println("Hello, Gophers! Let's build!")
}
```

**Run it:** `go run hello.go`
