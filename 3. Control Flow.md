## 🚦 Chapter 3: Control Flow (If/Else and Loops)

Go's control structures are designed for simplicity. It features standard `if/else` conditions and a single, powerful `for` keyword that handles all looping needs.

### 1. Conditional Logic (`if` and `else`)

Go's `if` statements are unique because they **do not require parentheses** around the condition, but they **must** have curly braces `{}`.

#### Example: Basic `if/else`

Go

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    age := 18

    if age >= 18 {
        fmt.Println("Access Granted: You are an adult.")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Access Denied: You are a minor.")
    }
}
```

#### The `if` Statement with a Short Initialization

A common pattern in Go is to initialize a variable _right_ before the condition is checked. The variable's scope is then **limited** to the `if` and `else` blocks. This keeps your code clean.

Go

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // 'result' is only available inside the if/else blocks
    if result := 90; result >= 90 { 
        fmt.Println("Grade A!")
    } else if result >= 70 {
        fmt.Println("Grade B.")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Try again.")
    }
    
    // fmt.Println(result) // ERROR: 'result' is undefined here!
}
```

### 2. Looping (`for`)

Go famously **does not have** `while`, `do-while`, or `foreach` keywords. Everything is handled by the versatile **`for`** loop.

#### A. Traditional C-Style Loop

This loop has an initialization statement, a condition, and a post-statement (like incrementing a counter).

Go

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // init; condition; post-statement
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ { 
        fmt.Println("Iteration:", i)
    }
}
/* Output:
Iteration: 0
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
*/
```

#### B. The "While" Loop Equivalent

By omitting the init and post-statements, the `for` loop acts exactly like a `while` loop.

Go

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    sum := 1
    
    // Only a condition is needed (like a 'while' loop)
    for sum < 100 { 
        sum += sum // sum = sum * 2
    }
    fmt.Println("Final sum:", sum) // Output: Final sum: 128
}
```

#### C. Infinite Loop

By omitting all components, you create an infinite loop. You must use `break` to exit it.

Go

```
// Infinite Loop (must use 'break' or it will run forever!)
for { 
    // Logic here
    break // Necessary to stop the loop
}
```
