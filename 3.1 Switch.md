## 🚦 The `switch` Statement (Conditionals) 🎯

The `switch` statement is a cleaner way to write a series of `if-else-if` statements. Go's `switch` is more flexible than those in many other languages, allowing it to handle both constants and conditional expressions.

### Basic Switch

Go's `switch` executes the selected case and then **automatically breaks** (no need for a `break` keyword), which prevents fallthrough.

#### Example: Basic Value Matching

Go

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    day := "Monday"
    
    switch day {
    case "Saturday", "Sunday": // Multiple values can be matched in one case
        fmt.Println("It's the weekend!")
    case "Monday":
        fmt.Println("Back to work.")
    default: // Executed if no case matches
        fmt.Println("It's a weekday.")
    }
}
// Output: Back to work.
```

### Switch without an Expression (Conditional Switch)

You can omit the expression next to the `switch` keyword. In this form, it becomes equivalent to a chain of `if-else-if` statements, but with cleaner syntax. The cases are now **Boolean expressions** that are evaluated sequentially.

#### Example: Range Matching

Go

```
package main

import "fmt"

func grade(score int) {
    switch { // No expression here; the switch evaluates true/false cases
    case score > 100:
        fmt.Println("Error: Score is too high.")
    case score >= 90:
        fmt.Println("Grade: A")
    case score >= 80:
        fmt.Println("Grade: B")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Grade: C or lower")
    }
}

func main() {
    grade(95) // Output: Grade: A
}
```

**Key Point:** The first case that evaluates to `true` is executed, and subsequent cases are skipped.

### Explicit Fallthrough (Rare)

If you explicitly need the control flow to continue executing the code in the subsequent case (like in C/C++), you must use the **`fallthrough`** keyword.

Go

```
switch i {
case 1:
    fmt.Println("This runs.")
    fallthrough // Forces execution of the next case
case 2:
    fmt.Println("This also runs.")
case 3:
    fmt.Println("This does not run (automatic break).")
}
// Output: This runs.
//         This also runs.
```
